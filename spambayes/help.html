<p>
This plugin will add Spam bayesian filtering to your weblog. This can be an 
effective tool to fight Comment and Trackback spam. However you need to 
understand the basic principles before you should consider using this plugin. 
Spam Bayesian is not the answer to every spam problem. 
The first problem you will encounter is the need for a trained filter. And only 
you can train your filter effectively. That&#039;s why this plugin does not 
come with any filters pre-installed. I considered this but it&#039;s impossible 
to determine whether you would consider some words as spam or not. 
</p>
<p>Ham is considered the opposite of Spam in the Spam fighting world. So ham is 
    what you would like to see as a comment or trackback to your items. Spam on 
    the other hand is what is considered unsollicitated (bulk) messages posted 
    on your weblog as a comment or Trackback</p>

        bayesian the principles</a></h2>


<p>
So let&#039;s see what Spam bayesian can do for you. Consider that you have 
trained your filter. The plugin provides some tools to feed the filter with 
both &#039;ham&#039; and &#039;spam&#039;
</p>

<p>
What happens when Spam Bayes receives a message for checking? It determines two 
probabilities. The first is whether the message could be considered ham, based on 
word frequencies. Second it considers whether the message could be considered 
spam again based on word frequencies. That&#039;s why you need to train 
SpamBayes with both ham and spam messages. The word frequencies can only be 
determined after you taught it enough words to determine the most likely 
category the message belongs to.

<p>
You should be aware by now of the importance of training. After installation the 
plugin menu shows you an option to train all available comments as ham 
<strong>&#039;Train HAM (not spam) with all comments&#039;</strong>. You can 
use this option to feed the filter all your available comments as ham. Make sure 
you don&#039;t have any spam comments on your site otherwise you will feed the 
filter the wrong messages as ham. 
</p>

<p>
You can undo this action with the option <strong>&#039;Remove all comments from 
    the HAM (not spam)&#039;</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Once you&#039;ve trained your filter with your comments you can remove the menu 
item from the list so you won&#039;t accidently click this option again. To do 
this choose <strong>&#039;Spam Bayes Options&#039;</strong> from the menu and 
set <strong>&#039;Show SpamBayes train all ham in menu?&#039;</strong> to 
<strong>no</strong>.

</p>

<p>
At this moment there are two ways to train your filter with spam messages. 
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1">
    The most important one is <strong>Spam Bayes training</strong> in the menu. 
    You can put any text you like in the textarea and tell the filter what type 
    of message you are feeding it.

</li>
<li class="level1">The second option is only available if you have have logging 
    enabled. The overview of logged events will show two links beside the event 
    logged. One for training ham and one for training spam. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you accidently choose the wrong category for a training session you can undo 
this. Choose <strong>Spam Bayes untraining</strong> from the menu. You&#039;ll 
see all trained messages (except the trained comments which are invisible in the 
overview. You can untrain those as explained earlier). When you want a document 
untrained simply click on the link <strong>untrain</strong> and the document is 
deleted from the list and all the word counts are updated to reflect the 
untraining of the document.
</p>



<h2 class="sectionedit5"><a name="spam_bayes_logging" id="spam_bayes_logging">Spam 
        Bayes logging</a></h2>


<p>
When enabled (defaults to <strong>no</strong>) all events that are captured by 
the plugin are logged. This logging is done in a separate database table and 
contains all the information that the plugin receives. You can view the events 
from the administration interface. The view is limited to 10 events per page. 
Each logged event has two handy links to train either spam or ham. That way you 
can quickly train the filter if a message is considered spam when it isn&#039;t 
or when a message is considered ham and it isn&#039;t.
</p>

<p>
<em class="u">Remember</em> that although Spam Bayes might capture spam events, 
they are not automaticly added to the filter. So even if Spam Bayes did a 
correct categorisation it is still a good idea to feed the filter some of the 
correct guesses as well.
</p>



<h2 class="sectionedit6"><a name="spam_bayes_options" id="spam_bayes_options">Spam 
        Bayes Options</a></h2>


<p>
There are a couple of options available for this plugin.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"> <strong>Score at which point we should 
            consider a text as spam?</strong> This sets the score that is needed 
            to determine wheter a message is considered spam.
</li>
<li class="level1"> <strong>To which 
            <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> should 
            spammers be redireted?</strong> If a message is posted and 
            considered spam, Spam Bayes will redirect the spammer to 
            this <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>. 
Defaults to http://127.0.0.1/ You could redirect them to 
http://yoursite.com/explain.htm and explain on that page what happened. 
</li>
<li class="level1"> <strong>Which words should not be taken into 
        consideration?</strong> This is a list of common words and words that 
        would lead to false positives. On my site for example I had a lot of 
        spamming for <strong>.org</strong> domains. This led the filter to 
        believe that all .org domains should be considered spam. Adding 
        &#039;org&#039; to the ignore list resolved this issue.
</li>
<li class="level1"> <strong>Show SpamBayes train all ham in menu?</strong> If 
    this option is enabled (default) there are two extra menu items available for 
    Spam Bayes. Giving you the option to submit all available comments on your 
    weblog as HAM messages. When set to <strong>no</strong> the menu options 
    won&#039;t be visible.
</li>
<li class="level1"> <strong>Show SpamBayes in quickmenu?</strong> If set to yes, 
    Spam Bayes will show up in the left menu of your Nucleus Administration 
    giving you a quick easy access to the Spam Bayes administration. Default: 
    <strong>no</strong>
</li>
<li class="level1"> <strong>Use SpamBayes action logging?</strong> If set to 
    yes, Spam Bayes will log all it&#039;s actions to the database. This is a 
    very convenient option but it can be harmful. When a spamrun hits your site 
    a lot of MySQL queries are done for Spam Bayes. Logging intensifies this 
    MySQL usage. The second downside of this option is space. The complete 
    message is stored when logging is done. So a big spamrun could easily add 
    10MB of data to your database. (You can of course clear the log from the 
    administration interface). Defaults to <strong>no</strong>. 
</li>
</ul>
